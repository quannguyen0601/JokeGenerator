# JokeGenerator

## Description

The team is having a party this weekend and asked you to create a backend API for getting jokes. One more thing: the team doesnâ€™t like telling similar jokes for a long time, so please make sure that the joke with the same keyword gets rate limited.
Project is implemented by using **Dropwizard** Framework and **Guice** DI. 

How to start the JokeGenerator application
---

1. Run `mvn clean install` to build your application
1. Start application with `java -jar target/JokeGenerator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server config.yml`
1. To check that your application is running enter url `http://localhost:8081`

Health Check
---

To see your applications health enter url `http://localhost:8081/healthcheck`

Requirement:
---
  
1. Joke REST API:

    URL: ``http://localhost:8081/api/joke/generate?query=gun``

2. Return jokes should contain only the full match of keywords.
   
   Please check ```IJokeService <- JokeService <- JokeServiceImpl```

3. RateLimit:
   
   I created a new annotation with name ```@RateLimiterByQueryRequired```.
   Change the following parameters in annotation as per your need:
   1. **parameter**: name of parameter in query param 
   2. **rateLimit**: Overall request count allowed in time limit.
   3. **timeLimit**: Overall time window to apple rate limit (Second).

   About algorithm of rate limit, i decided to use Sliding Window. Check out ```SlidingWindowRateLimitservice```. This class is subclass of ``RateLimitService``
